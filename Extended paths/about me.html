<h1>Who am I? Who is Diego Alvarez?</h1>

    <p>I was the typical drifted teenager that graduated at 17 from highschool.
        I never knew what I wanted in life but one day it hit me "what was i doing with my life?"
        <br >
         I took my family & friends into consideration....It eventually clicked & now I'm currently 19 years old, proud to say that my 
        dedication & determination to reach my goals are my priority.
    Willing to always learn new skills and put them to use. I have plans & I'll be damned if I let anyone or anything stop me from achieving them.
    <br >
    I love my family so no matter what roadblock I come across I'll be sure to overcome it so when I'm a succesful man I can have my family by my side.

  <H1>Current Quote in mind</H1>  
    <p>I recently started to live life with one quote in mind.
    <br >
    "The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding"
    <br >
    It's true most people in our current generation will spend their teens & early 20s wondering
    <br >
     "why is my life bad?" "who or what can i blame?" "what did i do to deserve this" but a very small fraction 
    will ask what should i do? "what can trully make my life have a meaning or simply just better?".
    <br > 
    Truth be told even a smaller fraction will actually dedicated the time & effort 
    to better their life. 
    <br >
    So next time you wonder "what did i do to deserve this?" most probable answer is nothing but there is a also chance you're doing nothing to make it better. Instead start wondering "what am i doing to better my life?"</p>
